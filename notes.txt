add timestamps so you can browse like normal history by time
time spent at each url?
hover node to see url
pressing back button and going to new page should branch from that node, not the leaf
right justify a new tab so that it looks like it saw the new tab immediately
when tabs[openerTabId] has no data, could init the opener map so that the tree can backfill the opener node
initializing data is a race condition to mutating the data (like in response to a tab being opened). make all reads and writes to state async and to and from storage api
try separate trees in vis network for each tree
green circle around tabs that are still open
reparent nodes so that you can disasociate new tabs from their parent or re-associate
thumbnails of page capture to see what page looked like when you were there
remove new tab node?
secure messages passed back and forth. I think any webpage could receive and send messages to and from me
use tabs.onUpdated?
investigate
    -what happens when adding a new permission
    -how to clear storage on extension from dev tools
transpile to lower ecmascript for older browsers
firefox
ctrl shift h keeps only one instance of tree up
are tab ids consistent across restarts when "pick up where you left of" setting is set? wondering if the tree will continue between restarts
maybe I shouild be doing this by historyitem referrer ids
if last node in tab was same url that you are about to add, dont add it. (this would require keeping tabIds in node info)
