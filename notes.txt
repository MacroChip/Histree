always collect data even when ui isn't up
pressing back button and going to new page should branch from that node, not the leaf
right justify a new tab so that it looks like it saw the new tab immediately
try separate trees in vis network for each tree
when tabs[openerTabId] has no data, could init the opener map so that the tree can backfill the opener node
green circle around tabs that are still open
reparent nodes so that you can disasociate new tabs from their parent or re-associate
thumbnails of page capture to see what page looked like when you were there
remove new tab node
secure messages passed back and forth. I think any webpage could receive and send messages to and from me
use tabs.onUpdated?
